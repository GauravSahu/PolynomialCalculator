Let f(n) = 2*n+3,

for n = 3, f(3) = 2*3+3 = 9

Now let's imagine a java function calculating such polynomial function passed as a String to it for the input values.
It's simply a library which turns String to Mathematical Expression and find out the value.

Not so efficient, but existing JAVA SE solution of turning a String to Mathematical Expression is mentioned here.

We are trying to find out more efficient solution for it.
